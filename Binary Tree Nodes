You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.

Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

Root: If node is root node.
Leaf: If node is leaf node.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sql-----------------

-- Select each node from the BST and classify it as Root, Inner, or Leaf
SELECT 
    CASE 
        -- If the node has no parent, it is the Root
        WHEN p IS NULL THEN CONCAT(n, ' Root')

        -- If the node appears as a parent of another node, it's an Inner node
        WHEN n IN (SELECT DISTINCT p FROM bst) THEN CONCAT(n, ' Inner')

        -- Otherwise, it is a Leaf node
        ELSE CONCAT(n, ' Leaf')
    END AS node_type
FROM bst
ORDER BY n ASC;
