You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.

Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

Root: If node is root node.
Leaf: If node is leaf node.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sql-----------------

select case 
    when p is null then concat(n,' Root')
    when n in(select distinct p from bst) then concat(n,' Inner')
    else concat(n,' Leaf')
    end
from bst
order by n asc;
